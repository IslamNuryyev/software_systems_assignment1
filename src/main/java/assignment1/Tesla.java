// Decorator design patterns create decorator classes, which wrap the original class and supply additional functionality by keeping the class methodsâ€™ signature unchanged.
// Decorator design patterns are most frequently used for applying single responsibility principles since we divide the functionality into classes with unique areas of concern.
// The decorator design pattern is structurally almost like the chain of responsibility pattern.
